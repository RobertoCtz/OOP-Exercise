# OOP-Exercise



## Getting Started

* Install Scala SBT from [Here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
* Add SBT to the environment variables


### Prerequisites


* You need to have Java 1.8+ installed to run this program.
* JAVA_HOME variable must be set up to where java is installed


### Installing

* Clone the project to your local machine using

```
git clone https://github.com/RobertoCtz/OOP-Exercise.git
```

Go to the project directory and run the scala project with

```
sbt run
```



## What is this?
The requeriments for this project were to create a public function that returns a Fibonacci serie of 10 numbers and to calculate this value using a private function.
Then, we created a second clculator class with an add and subtract method.
And at the end, we overrided our original public function to return 20 instead of 10 numbers of the fibonacci serie.
